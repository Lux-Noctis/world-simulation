# world-simulation
PURPOSE: Earth's geography will be uploaded that will be inhabited groups of AI. The AI will have to manage resources, trade, or go to war, while managing technologic growth. The AI will start from hunter-gatherer societies and may decide to settle later (or not at all) to become farmers and build societies ontop of that. This code should serve as a template for larger projects, whether used by economists to do simulations (for example, water running out and its impact on the area (mass migration, war, etc.)) or for military purposes (what trade route to cut off that hurts the enemy the most).
